                <p>Hi, my name is Jack Bendicsen. I am 19 years old and am from Wheaton, Illinois.
                    This is a town about 40 minutes from the Chicago and right next to Naperville. I started playing
                    music at the age of 12.
                    Shortly after this, my love for music took off. I started on guitar but throughout highschool played
                    bass guitar and ukulele
                    and am currently learning piano. I played in a few jazz bands in highschool, the highschool
                    showband, and a few different bands with my friends.
                    I used to work at the music store in my town, Suburban Music. Here I would work the cash register,
                    manage inventory and lesson schedulinng,
                    along with fixing all stringed intruments. It was here where I really found my passion of luthier
                    work. I have worked on a variety of instruments
                    including guitars (acoustic, classical, and electric), bass guitars, ukuleles, banjos, mandolins,
                    lap harps, drums, violins, violas, and cellos.
